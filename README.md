# Devops assessment project
This project is a simple web application that displays a list of items and allows the user to add new items to the list. The application is written in Python using the Django web framework. 

# Task 1: Version Control Integration
Under task 1, I have integrated the project with a version control system. I have used Git as the version control system and have created a repository on GitHub to store the project. The project is a simple web application that displays a list of items and allows the user to add new items to the list and perform all other CRUD operations. The database used is SQLite.
